**Customer Loyalty Marketplace Application

• Implemented a marketplace that manages customer loyalty programs for different brands.
• Brands can set up and configure a loyalty program (a regular or tiered loyalty program) for their brand and outsource its management to the marketplace platform.
• On the other hand, the marketplace offers a single point for customers to manage the different reward programs they participate in.
• Furthermore, there are marketplace admin accounts which the employees of the marketplace use to manage the platform.
